## Graphs Directory

This directory contains implementations of graph representations and algorithms in C++.

### Files:

- **graph_repr_matrix.cpp**: Implementation of graph representation using adjacency matrix.

- **graph_repr_weighted_list.cpp**: Implementation of graph representation using weighted adjacency list.

### How to Use:

1. Compile the C++ files using a compiler like .

2. Run the compiled executables to test the graph implementations.

### Notes:
- Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
- Refer to the comments in the code for detailed explanations.
