## Graphs Directory

This directory contains implementations of graph representations and algorithms in C++.

### Files:

- **graph_repr_matrix.cpp**: Implementation of graph representation using adjacency matrix.

- **graph_repr_weighted_list.cpp**: Implementation of graph representation using weighted adjacency list.

- **depth_first_traversal.cpp**: Implementation of depth first traversal using adjacency list.

- **breadth_first_traversal.cpp**: Implementation of breadth first traversal using adjacency list.

- **counting_connected_components.cpp**: Implementation for counting connected components using adjacency list.

- **count_islands.cpp**: Implementation for counting islands using adjacency matrix.

- **rotten_oranges.cpp**: Implementation for adjacent rotten oranges using adjacency matrix.

### How to Use:

1. Compile the C++ files using a compiler like .

2. Run the compiled executables to test the graph implementations.

### Notes:
- Ensure you have a C++ 20 compiler installed.
- Refer to the comments in the code for detailed explanations.
